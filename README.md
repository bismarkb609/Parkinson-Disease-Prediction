# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction

This project is about predicting whether a patient has a parkinson <br> 
disease based on some data taken from the person <br> 

The data for this project is obtained from UCI ML Parkinson dataset <br>

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from  <br> 
31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a <br> 
particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice <br> 
recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data  <br> 
is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" <br> 
column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.
